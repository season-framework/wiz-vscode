# Wiz VSCode Extension v1.1.0 Release Notes

## Summary

**v1.1.0** is a major update introducing new tree categories (Copilot, Config), file upload support, folder protection, and a complete architecture refactoring with a services layer.

---

## New Features

### Copilot Category
- New tree category for `.github` folder access
- Manage GitHub Copilot instructions directly from the explorer

### Config Category
- New tree category for project configuration files
- Quick access to `project/{project}/config/` directory

### File/Folder Upload
- Upload files and folders via Webview interface
- Fully compatible with VS Code Remote environments
- Supports both single files and directory uploads

### Folder Protection
- Source and Packages root folders are now protected from accidental deletion
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations on protected paths

### Project Export with Download
- Project export now triggers a download dialog
- Changed from file system save to browser-style download

---

## Architecture Improvements

### Services Layer (New)
- Introduced 3-tier service hierarchy: `project/`, `app/`, `file/`
- `BuildManager`: Build operations, Python environment management
- `ProjectManager`: Project lifecycle (switch, import, export, delete)
- `SourceManager`: Standard app/route management
- `PackageManager`: Portal package management
- `FileManager`: File operations (create, delete, copy, paste, rename)
- `NavigationManager`: File type switching and navigation
- `McpManager`: MCP server lifecycle

### Core Module Refactoring
- `AppCreator`: Extracted app creation logic into standalone class
- `ZipUtils`: Centralized zip/unzip operations
- `UploadWebview`: Reusable upload Webview component

### Extension.js Cleanup
- Business logic completely separated into service managers
- `extension.js` now serves as pure glue code for registration and wiring

---

## Improvements

### Explorer
- Improved sorting for Portal package folders (`info` > `app` > `route` > ...)
- Explorer bug fixes and display improvements

---

## Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/services/` | New — entire services layer (11 files) |
| `src/core/` | Refactored — AppCreator, ZipUtils, UploadWebview extracted |
| `src/extension.js` | Refactored — business logic removed, pure registration |
| `src/explorer/fileExplorerProvider.js` | Copilot/Config categories, sorting improvements |
| `src/explorer/models/categoryHandlers.js` | New category handlers |
