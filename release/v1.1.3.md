# Wiz VSCode Extension v1.1.3 Release Notes

## Summary

**v1.1.3** is a stability-focused patch release that resolves infinite loop issues in the tree explorer and improves file save performance with build debouncing.

---

## Bug Fixes

### Infinite Loop Prevention
- **Debounced Refresh**: Added `_deferRefresh()` to `FileExplorerProvider` to prevent cascading refresh when creating virtual folders
- **findItem Scope Limitation**: Added `MAX_LOOP = 50` iteration limit and `wizRoot` as additional termination boundary
- **Virtual Folder Whitelist**: Only predefined folder names (app types + common folders) are auto-created, preventing accidental creation of arbitrary directories

### File Save Performance
- **Build Debouncing**: Applied 500ms debounce to `triggerBuild()` — only the last save triggers a build during rapid consecutive saves
- **Build Process Management**: Separated build logic into `_execTriggerBuild()` with improved process termination via `process.kill(pid)`
- **Auto-Reveal Safety**: Skip auto-reveal for dirty documents, added 500ms timeout to `findItem`, added file existence check before `treeView.reveal()`

### Edit Tracking
- **Project Switch Cleanup**: `clearEditedDocuments()` called on project switch to prevent stale edit tracking from triggering unnecessary builds
