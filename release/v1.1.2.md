# Wiz VSCode Extension v1.1.2 Release Notes

## Summary

**v1.1.2** focuses on refactoring the save watcher system and fixing category-related issues for Copilot and Config tree nodes.

---

## Refactoring

### Save Watcher Migration
- **BuildManager Ownership**: Moved auto-build save watcher logic from `extension.js` to `BuildManager` for proper separation of concerns
- **Event Method Change**: Switched from `onWillSave` to `onDidChange` to correctly trigger builds for `wiz://` scheme files
- **Cleaner Initialization**: Removed monkey-patching patterns from `extension.js`, improved initialization order

---

## Bug Fixes

### Copilot/Config Category Fix
- **Dynamic resourceUri**: Copilot and Config category `resourceUri` now dynamically resolved to correct project paths (fixes file creation in wrong directory)
- **Parent Directory Auto-Creation**: File/folder creation in Copilot (`.github`) and Config categories now auto-creates parent directories
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Copilot and Config categories now properly support drag & drop operations
