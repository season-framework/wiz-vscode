> February 18, 2026

---

## Highlights

**v1.2.0** focuses on **package management** and **Python environment auto-discovery**. This release introduces visual Webview editors for managing npm and pip packages, and a QuickPick-based Python interpreter selector that automatically scans the system for available environments.

## New Features

### npm Package Manager
A visual Webview-based editor for managing npm packages in your Wiz project.

- **Install**: Enter package name with optional devDependency toggle
- **Uninstall**: One-click removal from package card
- **Upgrade**: Individual or bulk upgrade for all packages
- **Outdated Check**: Instantly see which packages have available updates
- **Real-time Search Filter**: Quickly locate packages in the installed list
- **Access**: Command Palette → `Wiz: npm Package Manager` or Settings menu

### pip Package Manager
A visual Webview-based editor for managing Python pip packages in the selected virtual environment.

- **Install / Uninstall / Upgrade**: Same workflow as the npm editor
- **Outdated Check**: Displays upgradeable packages via `pip list --outdated`
- **Auto Environment Selection**: Prompts for Python environment if not configured
- **Access**: Command Palette → `Wiz: pip Package Manager` or Settings menu

### Python Environment Auto-Discovery
Automatically scans the system for available Python interpreters when selecting an environment.

- **Scan Sources**: PATH, Conda, Pyenv, workspace venv, system paths
- **QuickPick Selection**: Displays version info and wiz installation status
- **Priority Sorting**: Environments with wiz installed appear at the top
- **Manual Fallback**: Option to enter a custom path if not listed

### Unified Settings Menu
The build menu has been restructured into a 4-item top-level settings menu.

| Menu Item | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Wiz Build | Select Normal / Clean build |
| Python Environment | Select Python interpreter |
| npm Package Manager | Open npm package editor |
| pip Package Manager | Open pip package editor |

## Improvements

### Build Stability
- **Build Debouncing (500ms)**: Only the last build request executes on rapid consecutive saves
- **Process Termination**: Improved reliability with `process.kill(pid)` for previous build processes
- **Edit Tracking Reset**: Clears previous project's edit state on project switch

### Explorer Stability
- **Debounced Refresh**: Prevents cascading refresh loops when creating virtual folders (100ms debounce)
- **findItem Loop Guard**: Maximum 50 iterations + wizRoot path as termination condition
- **Virtual Folder Whitelist**: Only allowed folder names are auto-created (prevents accidental arbitrary folder creation)
- **Auto-Reveal Safety**: Skips dirty documents, 500ms timeout, file existence check before `treeView.reveal()`

### Webview UI
- **Card-Based Layout**: Modern centered design with max-width 860px
- **@vscode/codicons Integration**: Native VS Code icons in Webview panels
- **Icon + Text Buttons**: Intuitive toolbar with labeled action buttons
